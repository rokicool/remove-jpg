This is supposed to be a folder for a script which is supposed to remove unnecessary files from the filesystem. 

But I managed to lost the harddrive with the script and now I am starting to write it again. It is SO silly, especially considering my speciality. But I was ablolutely sure that I have a 'backup' on GitHub. Still silly.
