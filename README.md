
This is supposed to be a folder for a script which is supposed to remove unnecessary files from the filesystem. 

But I managed to lost the harddrive with the script and now I am starting to write it again. It is SO silly, especially considering my speciality. But I was ablolutely sure that I have a 'backup' on GitHub. Still silly.

Not so reassuring I unsderstand. Anyways. 

I love taking pictures with my Sony A7RIII. It is an awesome camera. But. If you want to share the picture out of it wirelessly you need to have jpg file. On the other hand I definitely use RAW files in any other case. And when I import the photos to lightroom it takes both of the files - jpg and raw one. I have found that I spent something about 10-15% of my storage to sotore the unnecessary jpg files!

The main idea

The script checks the directory and finds all the jpg files which have corresponding raw files and only then deletes them! Recursively.
